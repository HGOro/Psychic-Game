# Psychic-Game
- A simple computer game featuring dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by Vanilla Javascript.
- This app runs in the browser and currently requires user input from a keyboard. I hope to make it phone and tablet compatible soon.

- The player has 10 opportunites to guess the correct letter each round.
* Player guesses are documented, but any repeated letters still count.
- Wins and losses are tracked and displayed.
- Depending on a win or loss, a message and image is displayed.

## Happy guessing!
